One of the primary applications is the detection of chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13. NIPT offers a highly accurate, low-risk alternative to invasive procedures like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This application is particularly valuable for high-risk pregnancies, where early and accurate detection of these conditions can significantly impact decision-making and management strategies. The ability of NIPT to deliver results with a high degree of accuracy and minimal risk to both mother and fetus has driven its adoption in various regions, making it a key application area in the global market.</p><p>Another important application of NIPT is gender determination, which is increasingly sought after by prospective parents. This application involves determining the sex of the fetus as early as the 10th week of pregnancy through a simple blood test. Gender determination is often a preferred choice for parents looking to plan and prepare for their child's arrival with greater precision. In addition to chromosomal abnormalities and gender determination, NIPT is also used for the assessment of fetal genetic conditions and potential risks associated with specific genetic disorders. These diverse applications enhance the overall utility of NIPT, supporting its continued growth and integration into prenatal care practices worldwide.</p></p><p id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Reseach Report @ <a target="">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=780628&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=251</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>GE Healthcare</Li><Li> Koninklijke Philips</Li><Li> Illumina</Li><Li> Thermo Fisher Scientific</Li><Li> F.
